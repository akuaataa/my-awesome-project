        <strong>Matcha </strong> is finely ground powder of specially grown and
        processed green tea leaves originating in China traditionally consumed
        in East Asia. It is mostly produced in Japan today. The green tea plants
        used for matcha are shade-grown for three to four weeks before harvest;
        the stems and veins are removed during processing. During shaded growth,
        the plant Camellia sinensis produces more theanine and caffeine. The
        powdered form of matcha is consumed differently from tea leaves or tea
        bags, as it is suspended in a liquid, typically water or milk.
